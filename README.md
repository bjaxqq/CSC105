### Course Description

Computation is an increasingly important problem-solving tool in any discipline as the amount and variety of available information rapidly grows. This course is an introduction to computer programming and computational problem solving explored within the context of various application domains. Students will solve interesting problems taken from disciplines across campus as they develop their programming skills. This course is open to everyone. Although only a tool for exploration, the programming language used will be a current popular language such as Python.

### Tools and Languages Used

This course is entirely focused on Python, which was written in Jupyter Notebook. We used the base library for Python as well as some for graphing such as Matplotlib and Pandas.
